In fact arguably, it has been said that Money is evil. Which is probably why majority of us are so angry at it we dispose our money as soon as it touches our hands. Actually sometimes, way before.'

In fact, money has been instrumental in the development of all the socio-political structures that we know of today. Since its inception, money has served as a universal unifying force that allowed peoples of different culture and background to cooperate and agree to a common interest.'

These are the non-essentials that simply adds clutter but no value to our lives and yet could be so easy to miss as they hide in plain sight. It could be the old clothes we keep in our closets that we never wore, the bad relationships we hold onto for old times sake, or the same life-draining job we cling to because it pays the bills.'

It can only be transferred or changed from one form to another. If that is the case, we should chose to transfer and transform our limited energy to the few but absolute essentials in our lives and get rid of the meaningless clutter that takes space and drain our energy.'

Anyway we use them will determine the outcome of our lives.'
